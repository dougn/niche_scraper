How this Document Works,,
,,"The data is scraped from the Niche website (link below.) Data is grouped into categories. The data is tabulated in multiple ways, some which can be sorted, and some that are easier to read or print. The data can be re-generated and imported. There is a script which accepts a list of URL's to the schools on Niche and generates the data to be imported. Some formatting is required post-import. The current list of schools is more of an example. Not all the desired data is currently available, and anything could be removed if it is found to not be helpful."
